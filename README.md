Deployed with docker-compose(infrastructure) and Minikube(Node.js workers):\

### About design
The app is meant purely as a demo for potential employers and that's why it's considerably over-engineered for its real size
(i.e. implements things it could probably live without). \
It is made for theoretical assumption of high load(many concurrent users) with possibility running in clusters.
